## Example

Hereâ€™s how you can create and use a menu in **LXR-Menu**:

```lua
RegisterCommand("lxrmenutest", function(source, args, raw)
    openMenu({
        {
            header = "Main Title",
            isMenuHeader = true,
        },
        {
            header = "Sub Menu Button",
            txt = "This goes to a sub menu",
            params = {
                event = "lxr-menu:client:testMenu2",
                args = {
                    number = 1,
                }
            }
        },
        {
            header = "Sub Menu Button",
            txt = "This goes to a sub menu",
            disabled = true,
            params = {
                event = "lxr-menu:client:testMenu2",
                args = {
                    number = 1,
                }
            }
        },
    })
end)
```

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('lxr-menu:client:testMenu2', function(data)
    local number = data.number
    openMenu({
        {
            header = "< Go Back",
        },
        {
            header = "Number: "..number,
            txt = "Other",
            params = {
                event = "lxr-menu:client:testButton",
                args = {
                    message = "This was called by clicking this button"
                }
            }
        },
    })
end)
```

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('lxr-menu:client:testButton', function(data)
    TriggerEvent('LXRCore:Notify', data.message)
end)
```
